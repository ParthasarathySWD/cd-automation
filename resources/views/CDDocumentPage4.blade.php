                                        impose fines and penalties or (2) place a tax lien on this property. If <br>
                                        you fail to pay any of your property costs, your lender may (1) add <br>
                                        the amounts to your loan balance, (2) add an escrow account to your <br>
                                        loan, or (3) require you to pay for property insurance that the lender <br>
                                        buys on your behalf, which likely would cost more and provide fewer <br>
                                        benefits than what you could buy on your own.
